Final project report gives project overview

Code contains Matlab code for 2 parts of project
-> Controller simulation is a simulation for feedback control of a robotic arm using positional information
	- Main file is controls_test.m
	- Output is a plot of the simulated noise & measured position vs actual position
-> RRT_Kinodynamic is a kinodynamic trajectory planner for a simulated robotic arm
	- Main file is Spheres.m
	- Output is a simulation of the trajectory in 3D
